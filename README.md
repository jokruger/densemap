Package densemap provides a generic, dense, ID-based mapping structure for fast, contiguous lookups by integer ID. Unlike Goâ€™s built-in map, densemap stores values in a slice indexed by a bounded integer range [minID, maxID]. This design ensures O(1) access, efficient iteration, and predictable memory usage, making it well-suited for cases where IDs are compact and naturally bounded (e.g., enums, small identifier spaces, event codes).
